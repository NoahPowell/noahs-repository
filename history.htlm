                            Like kanji, fireworks, and General Tsao's chicken 1, rock, paper, scissors was actually created in China. 
                            The game was created around the time of Christ, but stayed in China for hundreds of years. 
                            It wasn't until the 1700s that it made its way over to Japan. The rest, as they say, is history.

                            Rock–paper–scissors (also known as scissors–rock–paper or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people,
                             in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 
                             These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).
                              "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held 
                              upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.
